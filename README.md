# homeprice_prediction
A prediction model developed using python

I have worked on this project where we can predict home prices based on square feet area.

Steps performed in this project:

1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Reading 'homeprices.csv' file.
3. Plotting a scatter plot to get an idea of distribution of the data points.
4. Create linear regression object
5. Creating 'area.csv' file which will contain only area
6. Predicting the prices of 'area.csv' and saving it in 'prediction.csv'
